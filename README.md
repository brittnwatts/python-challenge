# python-challenge

This ReadMe serves to:
   1. Certify that this work is my own,
   2. Specify code source and its location in my 'python-challenge' repository,
   3. Clarify the reason for the assignment,
   4. Explain the code and how it works.


1. 
My name is Brittney Watts, and I am in the UNCC/EdX Data Analytics Bootcamp. Currently, we 
are working on Module 3 of our exploration into the Python programming languange in VSCode.

2. 
The source code is my interpretation of the information we have learned in class, and here
is a breakdown of the locations of each element of my assignment:

   python-challenge
      PyBank
         Analysis
            PyBank_analysis.txt (.txt output)
         Resources
            budget_data.csv
         main.py (source code for PyBank)
      PyPoll
         Analysis
            PyPoll_analysis.txt (.txt output)
         Resources
            election_data.csv
         main.py (source code for PyPoll)
      README

This assignment serves to track my understanding of the Python Language

PyBank:
   My task was to read the data from the csv file (budget_data.csv) and perform operations on it.
   The file is a collection of profits and losses over x months for a company.
   I was to:
      calculate the total number of months for which data was collected in the csv file,
      calculate the net total amount of profits and losses over the entire period for which data was collected,
      find the changes and average of those changes among the profits and losses,
      and find the greatest increase and decrease of profits over the entire period.
      The goal was to output all of this information seamlessly into the terminal and the PyBank_analysis.txt file.

PyPoll:
   My task was to read the data from the csv file (election_data.csv) and perform operations on it.
   The csv file is a collection of ballot votes for candidates in an election.
   I was to:
      calculate the total number of votes cast
      find the total number of votes and their percentages for each candidate relative to the total votes,
      and calculate the winner based on those numbers.
      The goal was to output all of this information seamlessly into the terminal and the PyPoll_analysis.txt file.
